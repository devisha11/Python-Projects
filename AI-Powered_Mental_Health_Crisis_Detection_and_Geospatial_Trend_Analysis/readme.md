AI-Powered Mental Health Crisis Detection with Geospatial Trend Analysis:

An open-source initiative to detect mental health crises and substance use patterns through social media analysis, enabling early intervention using NLP, sentiment analysis, and geographic mapping.
This project aims to identify mental health crises from Twitter data using AI-powered sentiment and behavioral analysis models. It incorporates geospatial and longitudinal mapping to monitor crisis trends over time.

Key Features:
-Tweet collection and filtering using the Twitter API
-NLP-based sentiment and emotion classification using BERTweet/RoBERTa
-Geospatial and temporal visualization using GeoPandas and Folium

Technologies:
-Python
-Hugging Face Transformers
-SQLite/JSON
-GeoPandas
-Folium

Challenges:
-Access to geo-tagged tweets
-Ethical and privacy considerations
-Model training on imbalanced data

Future Scope:
-Real-time alert dashboard
-Multi-language support
-Integration with public health systems
